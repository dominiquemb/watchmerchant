          <h2>Listing Adverts</h2>
          <p>We list your available stock on a sleek, simple and attractive advertising platform.</p>

          <p>The initial results page displays a picture of the item along with key details such as Make, Model, Distance and
            Price (with finance if available) and the user can then decide if they would like more information.</p>
          <p>This will then display information for the item showing all details except the seller’s.</p>
          <p>Simple site registration will reveal further details such as options to email the seller, call the seller, visit

          <h2>Broker Service</h2>
          <p>Using Watch Merchant UK’s Broker Service dealers will receive requests direct from the buyer.</p>
          <p>This removes the need for buyers to contact multiple dealers also the need to negotiate with the dealer. Users
            will be able to choose their item based on various specifications and then receive offers direct from a seller
            at their best price.
          </p>
          <p>The user will fill out a form on our site which will then be distributed to all subscribed dealers. As a dealer
            you can then send your best price for that watch if you have it or can source it for them, potentially gaining
            a customer where you wouldn’t have before based on the stock you currently hold.</p>
          <p>An email response from the interested parties will then be sent directly to the user showing the price (outright
            or finance option), and any other features the seller offers.</p>
          <p>For example, a buyer approached Watch Merchant UK for a price for a Rolex Daytona in yellow gold. Through our platform
            this request was sent to subscribed dealers. He saved £5,550.00 off the list price by getting multiple quotes
            at the touch of a button. We bring the quotes, they choose their preferred supplier.</p>
          <p>Watch Merchant UK passed that buyer directly to the dealer and they did the deal, without us that dealer wouldn’t
            have won that sale.</p>

          <h2>VIP Appointment Booking</h2>
          <p>Our VIP Appointment Booking is a chance to add that extra air of luxury to a sale.</p>
          <p>Through our platform customers can book an appointment direct with subscribed dealers. Without this service the
            dealers rely on the customer getting in contact with them off their own back by phone or email.</p>
          <p>We offer a diary through our platform where potential buyers can request appointments from dealers direct in order
            to view the item for sale.</p>
          <p>We want to ensure buyers don’t have to leave our website to confirm their interest and take it to the next step.</p>
